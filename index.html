									Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most
									popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and
									diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the
									well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.

											<h5>Cat Requirements Through Their Lives</h5>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row mb-2">
										<div class="col">
											<h6>Zero to Four Weeks</h6>
											It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing)
											directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its growth rate
											is
											progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed
											the
											kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight
											appropriately include the following:
											too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk
											gastrointestinal disease
											environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row mb-2">
										<div class="col">
											<h6>Four Weeks to One Year</h6>
											Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after
											birth.
											According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine
											ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of
											water
											can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional
											nutrients
											that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have different
											dietary requirements. You should always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row mb-2">
										<div class="col">
											<h6>One Year to Seven Years</h6>
											This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their level
											of
											activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to leave food out for the cats
											all
											day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the
											day.
											This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row mb-2">
										<div class="col">
											<h6>Seven Years and More</h6>
											Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at
											this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
											packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and <strong> not </strong>
											just
											a category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality
											proteins.

										Introduction
										</h5>
										The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds
										recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies
										cite the social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog.
										Studies even show medical indicators such as <a
											href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554">reduced blood pressure and improved lipid
											profiles.</a> If you have a dog, it
										is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough
										opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the
										various stages of their lives.

									<h5>Diet & Exercise</h5>
									<div class="row mb-2">
										<div class="col">
											Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature. Puppies should be nursed
											the
											first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to six months years old.
											Their
											food intake should be reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced
											to
											one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog’s typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70
											percent water. The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a> says just a 10
											percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can
											cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row mb-4">
										<div class="col">
											Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs healthy, as well as sun and
											fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed and size differences, but
											generally a
											range of 30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I
											know
											that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way,
											exercising your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can
											also choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do
											not
											pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require supervision.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row mb-4">
										<div class="col">
											<h5>Grooming & Handling</h5>
											Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush frequently to reduce the
											amount
											of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for
											insects
											such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only important to your
											dog’s
											health but can be an exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any
											residual soap
											can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic
											reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you need to
											be
											cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest
											and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both your arms perpendicular
											to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col">
											<h5>Vaccinations & Medications</h5>
											You should <strong>always</strong> consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are
											typically
											recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others
											may
											be determined by your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include <a
												href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet">Bordetella
												bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.</a>

									<h5>Introduction</h5>
									Sometimes we want a pet in our life but think it’s impossible because we are not home enough to take care of it,
									or we don’t have enough room. Consider adopting a small animal such as a hermit crab, mouse, gerbil, hamster,
									guinea pig, or even a chinchilla! Depending on which type of animal you adopt, you can provide a comfortable
									environment using anything from small to large cages or glass aquariums. You will also need to provide amenities
									for your new pet, such as bedding or substrate, toys, an exercise wheel, a water dish or drip bottle, a food
									dish, and grooming equipment. You also need to consider if your new pet will need a friend or if it will be
									happy living alone. Our “Pexperts” are here to help you decide which pet is right for you and how to provide
									them with a happy home. Schedule a consultation with us today!
